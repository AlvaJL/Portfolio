                <h1 class="about">About <span class=red>myself</span></h1><br>
                <p class="pcenter">I’m currently in my first year of studying Interaction Design at Malmö University. I decided to join this program in hopes of becoming a brilliant UX-,UI- & Interaction designer in the future and are therefore looking to develop my skills in this field in order to reach my goals.<br> <br>

                    I have always loved to be creative and innovative, in my childhood I built everything between soapboxes to secret treehouses with my cousins, growing up I started to join my dad's construction projects and realised that I love the planning and problem solving that goes into the work. It is a special feeling to be a part of building something together as a team and the journey the team makes together to get to a result everyone can be proud of and have others taking part of the project outcome. Other passions I have is sketching, I like to express and show things visually. This is one of my favorite things to do outside of school when I need to stimulate my creative needs and have a break from the busy environment.  
                    
                    </p>
                <br><h1 class="about">About <span class=red>my studies</span> </h1><br>
                <p class="pcenter">The program Interaction Design at Malmö University prepares us students to meet the field of design by teaching us contemporary technologies and methods for us to take with us into careers such as interaction -, user experience -, user interface -, service - designers and many more. We get to participate in various projects with our peers to gain collaborative experience and to advance our project management skills. I’m looking forward to learning as much as I can during these years both from school studies and from field practice.
